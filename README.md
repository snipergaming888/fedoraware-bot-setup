# fedoraware-bot-setup
auto-inject and restart tf2 with fedoraware. orginal credit goes to Trollsec/Reality.
usage: open a cmd and cd to the directory were main.py is at.
do "python main.py"
after tf2 has lauched, you will need to edit the config "botsniper" (this is the defualt config that loads on startup)
